Look Down

Look Down is an interactive installation that invites participants to notice the overlooked textures beneath their feet â€” wet pavement, fallen leaves, scattered confetti.

By blending tactile and digital interactions, the piece encourages quiet observation and playful discovery of ground-level details we often ignore.

âœ¨ Concept

The ground holds stories we rarely see. Look Down makes those textures visible and engaging by translating the act of stepping into projected visuals. Each visitorâ€™s movement triggers unique responses, drawing attention to the surfaces they traverse and their fleeting beauty.
